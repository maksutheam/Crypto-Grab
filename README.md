To the moon! Get as much money as possible by pumping and dumping crypto-currencies!

How to play:

Get as much Money as possible! To do that, you need to do Actions to pump up the Crypto Value of your Crypto, and Cash out at the peak to get loads of money!

The crypto market is unwieldy, sometimes the value crashes quickly and other times actions don't add much to the value at all. You'll need luck and patience to come on top!

 But beware, some actions also build up Suspicion on your operation, and sometimes bad things happen when you have a lot of it...

Actions:

Promise unfulfillable things: Promise your fans that you're going to make a metaverse or MMORPG or a new coin to build a little bit of hype! Adds 1 Suspicion

Collab with a celebrity: Costs 3 Money and one Crypto (hohoho, sucker) to build most hype of all options! Adds 1 Suspicion

Hack a social media account: Hey, as long as it works. Gets you more than Promises, but adds 4 Suspicion.

Sell a Crypto: Exchange 1 Crypto and get 1 * Crypto Value in return! In case you need money for influencers.

Mine Crypto: Get 1 Crypto. You know, for selling it later.

Cash out: Sell all your valuable (not really) crypto and get that * crypto value in return, so you can begin your next crypto scheme!


btw i freaking hate cryptocurrencies this game isn't a tribute to them or anything id rather eat a 3080 than mine crypto with it

i made it crypto themed cuz, you know, "to the moon" and all that? that still fits the theme, right?
